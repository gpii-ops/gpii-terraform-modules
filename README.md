# gpii-terraform

Following the pattern laid out in [How to create reusable infrastructure with Terraform modules](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules) and [Terragrunt: Remote Terraform configurations](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#remote-terraform-configuration), this repo contains the modules ("blueprints") used to describe the infrastructure. The deployed infrastructure ("houses") based on these modules lives [here](https://github.com/mrtyler/gpii-terraform)-live.
