**DEPRECATED! Go to [gpii-terraform](https://github.com/mrtyler/gpii-terraform) instead. This repo remains to support archaeological expeditions.**

Following the pattern laid out in "[How to create reusable infrastructure with Terraform modules](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d)" and "[Terragrunt: Remote Terraform configurations](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry), this repo contains the modules ("blueprints")" used to describe the infrastructure. The deployed infrastructure ("houses") based on these modules lives [here](https://github.com/mrtyler/gpii-terraform-live).
